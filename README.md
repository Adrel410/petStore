# Pet Store Simulation in Io

## Author: Adeola Ogundipe

### What I Liked About Using Io:
1. **Simplicity**: Io's syntax is easy to understand and use.
2. **Dynamic Objects**: Its prototype-based object model allows for flexible object manipulation.
3. **Interactive Development**: Io's REPL makes experimentation and debugging straightforward.

### Challenges with Io:
1. **Limited Ecosystem**: Finding libraries and resources can be challenging due to Io's small community.
2. **Sparse Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and tutorials are lacking in Io's official documentation.
3. **Performance Concerns**: Io's performance may not match other languages, particularly for intensive tasks.

### Key Reference:
I relied on the [official Io documentation](https://iolanguage.org/docs/Home.html) for understanding Io's features and syntax.
